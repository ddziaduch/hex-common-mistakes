# Hexagonal architecture common mistakes

## Problem five - what is the difference between Ports & Adapters, Onion and Clean?

The goal of this code is to show that there is not much difference between these architectures.

The Onion architecture is based on the Ports & Adapters and the DDD.
It separates the Domain in the Application core.

The Clean architecture is based on the Ports & Adapters, Clean, DDD, DCI and DCI.
It also separates the Domain, but also introduces the Use Cases.
